# Package Delivery System

This package delivery system is a command-line application built with Python. It simulates the delivery process of a courier service by managing package deliveries using a hash table for efficient 
data storage and retrieval. The system allows users to check the status of packages, view total mileage, and print package statuses within a specific time window.

## Features

- Load and manage package data using a custom hash table.
- Deliver packages using a greedy algorithm to determine the most efficient routes.
- Check the delivery status of individual packages.
- Calculate and display the total mileage covered by the delivery trucks.
- Print the status of packages delivered within a given time window

## Out of Scope

This package delivery system is designed with specific functionalities and limitations. The following aspects are out of the scope of this project:

- Real-time GPS tracking of delivery trucks.
- Integration with external APIs for address verification or real-time traffic updates.
- Mobile application or web-based interface for package tracking by customers.
- Automatic synchronization of data with other systems or databases.
- Handling payments or billing information related to deliveries.
- Management of return or undeliverable packages.
- Advanced analytics or reporting features for logistics performance.
- Automated scheduling of truck maintenance or tracking of truck conditions.

These features could be considered for future versions of the project.
